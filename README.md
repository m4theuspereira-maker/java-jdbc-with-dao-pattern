# java-jdbc-with-dao-pattern
In this repository there's a demonstration of my learning about the DAO pattern in Java, used to save datas into a database SQL as MySQL(which i've used in this example) or PostgreSQL.
In this project was used too the basics of JUnit to test automatically  operations such as save, update, find all and delete.
